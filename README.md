Simple setup of a small app with Netlify integration.

App preview: https://pensive-shockley-b9ada8.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

```
yarn start
```

## Notes:

1. Make changes and commit on a feature branch

2. Create pull request for the feature branch

    - Creating the PR will kick off the Netlify builds
    - Netlify will automatically deploy a preview of the app to a temp URL


3. When happy with the changes, merge the GitHub PR into master.
    - Netlify will deploy the site to the production URL.
